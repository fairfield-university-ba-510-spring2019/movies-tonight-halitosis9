    "**Try out the [Movies Tonight](http://christopherhuntley.github.io/movies-tonight) web app.** This web app was originally developed as a Javascript demo for a database design class in 1996. It provides information about every movie shown in Riverside, California, on Thanksgiving 1996. The code is ancient –– Javascript was just 2 years old at the time –– and won’t work in some modern browsers. It should work fine in Chrome and Firefox, however."

Each record is on a line and is one of three types (M, S, and T). Depending on the record type, the last field may be repeated if there are multiple values, making the # of fields variable (even when the record type doesn’t change).\n",
    "- **Format 2** is a slightly different arrangement, again with three record types. This time the repeated fields are split into separate records. To conserve characters in the file, fields are left blank if the values are the same in the record above it.\n",
    "- **Format 3** combines all three record types into a single record, at the cost of being extremely verbose and redundant. Notice how many rows the sheet has! Each record represents a single **movie credit** within a single **movie showing** at a given time at a **single theater**. (Read that three times to be sure you understand before going on.)     \n",

    "2. **Within your new BA510 folder, use the New menu to create a new Luchidchart diagram.** You will need to ask for \"more\" doc types in the \"New\" menu.\n",

    "4. **Close any extraneous shape panels on the left.**  \n",
    "![Closing Shape Panels](img/img5.png)  \n",
    "Just the shape panel for ERDs should remain.\n",
    "5. **Drag the leftmost Entity prototype to the drawing canvas.**  \n",
    "![Dragging an Entity](img/img6.png)  \n",
    "The entity shape will have slots for an entity (class) name and three attributes. Edit to match your first table. Then repeat for each table in your design.\n",

    "To connect two entities, just click on an entity to make the 'drag circles' appear around its perimeter.  \n",

    "7. **Rename the file to `MoviesTonightERD` and save it.**  \n",

    "![Download](img/img11.png)  \n",
    "The file will be downloaded as a PNG file wherever your browser usually downloads things.\n",
    "9. **Find the file on your hard disk and move it into your repository folder.**  \n",
    "10. **Rename the file to just `MoviesTonightERD.png`**.   \n",
    "11. **Upload the file to this project folder in JupyterLab.** If you named the file correctly, then it should display in the following cell once you \"run\" it. "
